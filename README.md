# docker-dev-enviroment

## Description

Scripts and services I normally use for Software Development. The solution is based on Docker and Docker-Compose.

## How to use

Use the script inside each directory to create o destroy the directory services.

Example to start the databases services:

```bash
$ cd databases
$ sh create.sh
```
